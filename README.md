Stopwatch widget for timingandestimationplugin
==============================================

Summary
-------

The TaE maintainer, Russ, has been very positive about this widget. At the time of writing, he is working to include it in the main TaE repo/distribution.

In the meantime, you can get this in two ways:

1. The 'master' branch, which is a ready-for-install replacement of TaE 0.11.

2. The 'export' branch, which has adds/replaces files in TaE.
